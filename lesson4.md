# Loops

## Parts of a While Loop

1. When to start (define starting value of a variable, for example.)
2. When to stop (logical condition to test whether the loop should continue)
3. How to get to the next item: (incrementing or decrementing)

Example

```javascript
var start = 0; // when to start
while (start < 10) { //when to stop
	console.log(start);
	start = start + 2; // how to get to the next item
}
```

> Prints
> 0
> 2
> 4
> 6
> 8

Never ending loops happen when there stop condition is missing. For example:

```javascript
// Don't run this code!
while (true) {
	console.log("true is never false, so I will never stop!");
}
```

## Quiz: 99 Bottles of Juice (4-2)

Write a loop that prints out the following song. Starting at 99, and ending at 1 bottle.

```
99 bottles of juice on the wall! 99 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 98 bottles of juice on the wall!
98 bottles of juice on the wall! 98 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 97 bottles of juice on the wall!
...
2 bottles of juice on the wall! 2 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 1 bottle of juice on the wall!
1 bottle of juice on the wall! 1 bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 0 bottles of juice on the wall!
```
Some Notes:

Note the pluralization of the word "bottle" when you go from 2 bottles to 1 bottle.
Your text editor may try to autocorrect your ellipses ... to the ellipses character â€¦ Do not use the ellipses character for this quiz.
